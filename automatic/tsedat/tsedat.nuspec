TheSage is a comprehensive English dictionary and thesaurus that provides a number of useful and in some cases unusual search tools.

The project is rooted in research. TheSage is, in fact, a research instrument. We are linguists with various interests in the field. Among these are word knowledge and vocabulary acquisition. We first developed this project to serve our investigative concerns. Colleagues soon asked for copies, then it was acquaintances of acquaintances, eventually we were contacted by complete strangers. The initial public release of TheSage must already be more than a decade old.

TheSage inherited its core wide-ranging scope from Princeton's George Armitage Miller WordNet, of which it is an early branch. Since the turn of the century, TheSage has grown by leaps and bounds, following its own path and differentiating itself from its progenitor in too many ways to count. There are several good (and not so good) dictionaries out in the wild. Both in content and in capacity, however, TheSage stands above the rest. It needs to. We rely on TheSage to carry out our work.

The scope of the dictionary is that of English as an international language. It contains entries from dialects around the world, including their variant spellings and senses. For consistency, definitions are written using American English. Some of TheSage's characteristics are:

Index	~250,000
Senses	~315,000
Etymologies	~69,000
Thesaurus	~1,850,000 relationships (synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms, holonyms,...)
Examples of use	~55,000
Pronunciations	~135,000 phonetic transcriptions
Requests for ports have steadily increased over the years. It is a natural consequence of the fragmentation of the operating system landscape brought about by the so-called mobile revolution. The technical costs involved have become significant.

We will continue providing TheSage for free, as we always have. From version 7 on, we also provide a professional edition for a small fee. We hope that English language lovers and casual users alike will appreciate the value of the project and see fit to support its continuing development on Windows and other platforms.
