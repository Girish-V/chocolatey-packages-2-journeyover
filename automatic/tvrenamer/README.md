TVRenamer is a Java GUI utility to rename TV episodes from TV listings
It will take an ugly filename like **Lost.S06E05.DD51.720p.WEB-DL.AVC-FUSiON.mkv** and rename it to **Lost [6x05] Lighthouse.mkv**

## Features

- Rename many different shows at once from information from [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/)
- Customise the format and content of the resulting filename
- Native look and feel for your operating system
- Drag and Drop or standard 'add file' interface
- Optionally move renamed files, i.e. a NAS or external HDD
