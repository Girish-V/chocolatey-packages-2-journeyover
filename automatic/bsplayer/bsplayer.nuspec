BS.Player is one of the best media player on the market today. Main advantages of the player are high quality playback, support for wide range of media files and it is low in CPU and memory consumption.

BS.Player is used by more than 70 millions of users throughout the world and it has been translated into more than 90 languages. All the downloaded versions of free player surpass the sum of all downloads of competitive video players and payable DVD players. Because it does not use much processing power it is suitable for all those who use slightly less capable computers but still want to have excellent video and audio quality. The multimedia playback has not been – and never will be – disturbed by any annoying technical problem, much too often experienced with software of this kind.

Most importantly, BS.Player, a free media movie player, is a product for the world multi media market and is therefore equipped with advanced subtitle options which enable the users to watch video content with subtitles from many popular subtitle formats (MicroDVD .sub, VobSub .sub + .idx, SubViewer .sub, (Advanced) SubStation Alpha .ssa or .ass, SubRip .srt, VPlayer .txt...). BS.Player is also a AVCHD player and enables you to display AVCHD video format movies (Advanced Video Codec High Definition) used in digital tapeless camcorders. It can automatically search and download missing subtitles for currently playing video, if available.

* BS.MediaLibrary

All multimedia files on your computer's hard drive will now be listed in the BS.MediaLibrary™. From now on they will always be within your reach. MultilingualBS.Player™ is an international product, targeted to all and any user worldwide.
