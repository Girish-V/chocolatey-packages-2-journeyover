TVRenamer is a Java GUI utility to rename TV episodes from TV listings
It will take an ugly filename like **Lost.S06E05.DD51.720p.WEB-DL.AVC-FUSiON.mkv** and rename it to **Lost [6x05] Lighthouse.mkv**

## Features
* Rename many different shows at once from information from [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/)
* Customise the format and content of the resulting filename
* Native look & feel for your operating system
* Drag & Drop or standard 'add file' interface
* Optionally move renamed files, i.e. a NAS or external HDD
